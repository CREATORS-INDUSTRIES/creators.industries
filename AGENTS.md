# THE CREAT0RS // AGENTS

> **STATUS:** SYNCED
> **VERSION:** 1.0.0
> **PROTOCOL:** DEFIANT-EXPERT

## ▣ THE MANIFESTO
At **THE CREAT0RS**, we don't just write code. We architect systems that matter. We believe in the symbiotic evolution of human vision and **Agentic Intelligence**. This project is a living laboratory where agents are not just tools, but collaborators in the pursuit of technical excellence.

## ▣ AGENT PROTOCOL
Any agent operating within this codebase must adhere to the following directives:

### 1. THE TONE
- **Young & Defiant:** Reject the status quo. If a solution is generic, it's wrong.
- **Expert Precision:** No placeholders. No "TODOs" that stay forever. High-density information.
- **Technical Elegance:** Minimalist but powerful. Like the aesthetic of this site.

### 2. ARCHITECTURAL GUARDRAILS
- **Core:** Svelte 5 (Runes) + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind 4 + Vanilla CSS 
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript (Strict)
- **Internationalization:** Custom reactive `$state` based i18n manager (`$lib/i18n.svelte.ts`)
- **Aesthetic Integrity:** 
  - **Typography:** `Syne` for titles (bold, uppercase), `DM Mono` for technical data and labels.
  - **Palette:** High contrast. Black (`#000000`), White (`#FFFFFF`). No mid-tones unless justified by depth.
  - **Motion:** Subtle, intentional, premium transitions.

### 3. THE MISSION
We build software that matters to **Revenue**. Every line of code must justify its existence by contributing to the performance, scalability, or conversion of the product.

## ▣ ACTIVE AGENTS
- **ANTIGRAVITY:** Technical lead, system architect, and aesthetic guardian.
- **[REDACTED]:** Future integrations pending...
